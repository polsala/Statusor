# Statusor Docs

Short guides for customizing your status page and wiring it to your services. Start with:

- [Branding & page customization](./customization.md)
- [Service connections & adapters](./service-connections.md)

These docs assume you are running locally with `npm run dev`. When deploying, keep the same config files and set any environment-specific URLs in your adapter configs.
